	<p>Self-driven, passionate, and never short on new ideas. I recently moved back and transferred into San Francisco State University’s Industrial Design program. Strengths are in rapid prototyping with an eye for fine detail and craftsmanship. “Why do something if it’s not done right!” Hands-on designer from ideation,to final product development. Effective in both self-management and team environments.

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
